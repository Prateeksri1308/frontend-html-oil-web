Let me know when you add JavaScript — I’ll update this README with interactivity details like cart, scroll effects, or APIs.

Would you like me to:
- Help you deploy this now?
- Generate a `.zip` of project folders for upload?
- Create a **custom hero banner** or **animated CSS button**?

Just say the word!
